# Hardware Requirements

Like any Cosmos-SDK chain, the hardware requirements are pretty modest.

`Minimum Hardware Requirements`

- 4x CPUs; the faster clock speed the better
- 8GB RAM
- 100GB of storage (SSD or NVME)
- Permanent Internet connection (traffic will be minimal during mainnet; 10Mbps will be plenty - for production at least 100Mbps is expected)

`Recommended Hardware Requirements`

- 4x CPUs; the faster clock speed the better
- 32GB RAM
- 200GB of storage (SSD or NVME)
- Permanent Internet connection (traffic will be minimal during mainnet; 10Mbps will be plenty - for production at least 100Mbps is expected)
